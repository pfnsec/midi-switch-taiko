The Hori taiko drum seems to have an output endpoint as well.
Could this be used for some kind of verification/lockout?
We may need to scrape/capture traffic somehow if this is the case.

Evidently, the nRF52840 DK can power itself as a USB HID.
It remains to be seen whether or not it can power the MIDI breakout as well.
The datasheet for the 6n138s optocoupler suggests that current supply requirements
are very modest. The MIDI breakout board will likely need to have a jumper 
soldered to accept a 3.3v supply.
